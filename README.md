# My_mini_minecraft_game

The game is housed in a 32 by 32 dimensional world with clears skies...you can fall from the edges

My mini minecraft game was built using the python Ursina engine



The ursina engine provides a platform on which games can be built completely free of charge

I think I took my curiosity too far with this one but don't worry it's safe

Just like mini pong I don't currently have the executable file available 

Because, there are features I still which to add

However by simply installing the ursina engine you can play this mini craft game 

Guidlines

>>...First download the files in the repo by clicking on the code button and selecting zip from the drop down menu

>>...Unzip the files and open the folder with Vscode

>>>...Make sure you have the Ursina engine and python programming language installed
